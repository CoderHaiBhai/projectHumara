# TryDjango
try django is a practice project that I made using a Free-Code-Camp tutorial. This project was a tremendous learning opportunity for me & allowed me to learn about the following concepts:

* Domain name system 
* HTTP request 
* ports
* Role of a Backend Framework
* creating Database models
